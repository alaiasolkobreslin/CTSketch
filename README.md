DeepSoftLog is a neuro-symbolic framework which adds embeddings and neural networks to probabilistic logic programming using soft-unification.


## Install

DeepSoftLog was developed for Python 3.10.11. To install run:
```shell
conda create --name dsl python=3.10.11
pip install cython==0.29.36
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

DeepSoftLog has only been tested on MacOS and Linux. The exact inference requires [PySDD](https://github.com/wannesm/PySDD), which does not support Windows.

## Experiments

All experiments can be found in `src/experiments`. The hyperparameters for each experiment can be found in their respective `config.yaml` files. 
To run an experiment, use the following command:
```shell
python run_experiments.py <experiment_name> <config_path>
```
For example, to run the MNIST addition experiment:
```shell
python run_experiments.py mnist_addition deepsoftlog/experiments/mnist_addition/config.yaml
```

By default, training metrics and results are logged to wandb.
